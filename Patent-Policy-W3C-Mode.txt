## Patent Policy:  W3C Mode.

1.	**Licensing Commitment**. For materials other than source code developed by the Working Group, each Working Group 
      Participant agrees to make available any of its Essential Claims, as defined in the W3C Patent Policy 
      (available at http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), under the W3C RF licensing requirements Section 5 
      (http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205), in Approved Deliverables adopted by that Working Group 
      as if that Approved Deliverable was a W3C Recommendation. Source code developed by the Working Group is subject to 
      the license set forth in the Working Group charter.  
      
2.	**For Exclusion**. Prior to the adoption of a Draft Deliverable as an Approved Deliverable, a Working Group Participant 
      may exclude Essential Claims from its licensing commitments under this agreement by providing written notice of that 
      intent to the Working Group chair (“Exclusion Notice”). The Exclusion Notice for issued patents and published applications 
      must include the patent number(s) or title and application number(s), as the case may be, for each of the issued patent(s) 
      or pending patent application(s) that the Working Group Participant wishes to exclude from the licensing commitment set forth 
      in Section 1 of this patent policy. If an issued patent or pending patent application that may contain Essential Claims is 
      not set forth in the Exclusion Notice, those Essential Claims shall continue to be subject to the licensing commitments under 
      this agreement. The Exclusion Notice for unpublished patent applications must provide either: (i) the text of the filed 
      application; or (ii) identification of the specific part(s) of the Draft Deliverable whose implementation makes the excluded claim 
      an Essential Claim. If (ii) is chosen, the effect of the exclusion will be limited to the identified part(s) of the Draft 
      Deliverable. The Executive Director will publish Exclusion Notices.
