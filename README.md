# Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group

Welcome, this is the OMP Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group. 

The goal of OMP is to provide an open, based on industry standards, higher-level non-committal manufacturing reference architecture, enabling companies to align their shop floor infrastructure and systems while enabling industrial solutions to integrate faster.   

Therefore, the goal of this Working Group is to provide a fully scalable reference architecture blueprint to simplify deployment and management of the entire cloud and edge manufacturing environment. Across most manufacturing customers, there are several common infrastructure patterns and best practices that should be applied when architecting a scalable end-to-end solution. These patterns can be combined and applied with the necessary services to build a modular framework tailored to manufacturing. The blueprint should help manufacturers to handle complex engineering tasks, such that manufacturers are not required to build these mechanisms from the ground up. 

This Working Group will ensure, that artifacts provided by other working groups can be integrated easily. To achieve this, rules, guidelines & directives are provided by this working group. 

The Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group will define architectural blueprints, diagrams, whitepapers, and descriptions demonstrating how different technological components fit together to provide a solution.  It may contain qualitative descriptions of each component as well as schematic blocks.  For example, a reference architecture component could identify and define patterns for data ingestion or deployment between the cloud and the edge.  At the same time, it may also explore new business models, such as an architectural framework to operate securely and self- sufficient on shared industrial data platforms.  The working group will embrace pre-existing open reference architectures from across the industry and will have a tight integration with the other OMP Working Groups.

## Introduction to the OMP Manufacturing Reference Architecture
### A white paper authored by the Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group

The Manufacturing Reference Architecture Working Group introduces their view on manufacturing characteristics,
challenges and use case considerations for architecture design. In addition, the whitepaper discusses required platform capabilities and architecture design principles for a successful implementation. This paper is the initial publication future OMP work will reference an be based upon.
